# Respiratory-diseases-recognition-through-respiratory-sound-with-the-help-of-deep-neural-network
Prediction of respiratory diseases such as COPD(Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), URTI(upper respiratory tract infection), Bronchiectasis, Pneumonia, Bronchiolitis with the help of deep neural networks or deep learning. We have constructed a deep neural network model that takes in respiratory sound as input and classifies the condition of its respiratory system. It not only classifies among the above-mentioned disease but also classifies if a personâ€™s respiratory system is healthy or not with higher accuracy and precision.
